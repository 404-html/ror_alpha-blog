# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
# 14/4/19: Removed these! It took a LONG time to work out that these fixtures are part of the test database!!! Now commented out!
# one: {}
# column: value
#
#two: {}
# column: value
